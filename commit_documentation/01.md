# Why doing this?
- Consistency across all your environments â€” development, staging, production, whatever more you have. Bundler gives your a guarantee, that software that worked on your environment will work on remote environment sharing the same Gemfile and Gemfile.lock
- Having the build run on a local machine, and with Gemfile and Bundler your teammate's  machine or the CI remote machine or any other random worker machine will be running with the same environment
- *** you and your project fellows stop fighting pod install diffs from different cocoapods versions, just because you share Gemfile / Gemfile.lock and have the same development environment

# What is Bundler and Ruby gems
- Bundler is a simple and powerful dependency manager for Ruby gems
- Two of most popular iOS development tools (cocoapods and fastlane) are written almost entirely in ruby and are distributed as Ruby gems

# Steps
- Install Bundler by running `gem install bundler`
- Create a Gemfile in the project root folder
- `bundle install`, Bundler will generate Gemfile.lock
- From now on, use command `bundle exec pod install` and not just pod install
